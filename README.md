Sphinx-Gallery
==============

Sphinx extension for automatic generation of an example gallery.

Getting the package
-------------------

There is work in progress to put this package in PyPi. Wait for a while, please!

Install as developer
--------------------
You can get the latest development source from our Github repository.
You need `setuptools` installed in your system to install. A future migration
to the standard distutils is planned.

You will also need have installed:
* Sphinx
* matplotlib
* pillow
* scikit-learn

But if you don't the `setuptools` will try to install them for you


```
$ git clone https://github.com/sphinx-gallery/sphinx-gallery
$ cd sphinx-gallery
$ python setup.py develop
```
