   contain the root `toctree` directive.

Welcome to Sphinx-Gallery's documentation!
==========================================

A Sphinx extension that builds an HTML version of any python
script and puts it into an examples gallery.

It is extracted from the scikit-learn project and aims to be an
independent general purpose extension.

Why do we need it?
------------------

* Because we have a lot of code that does something good enough for
  someone to learn about it.
* Looking to the visual output is simpler to our minds than reading
  the source code.
* The Gallery workflow:
   * Search for something that more or less looks to what you want
   * Learn about it

How does it look like
---------------------

You can structure your gallery from your python scripts and embed it
in any place of your website. And it look like the next sample.

.. include:: modules/generated/numpy.linspace.examples
.. raw:: html

        <div style='clear:both'></div>

Here we put only the examples of our gallery that use a specific
function. This display granularity ready to use within your
documentation, not just the gigantic galleries with all the examples
together.

Go ahead, click on those thumbnails to go to the examples. Beautifully
rendered HTML versions of the original python scripts with, narrating
prose from the doctrings and inline comments and plots generated by
the scripts.
