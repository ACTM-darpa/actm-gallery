   contain the root `toctree` directive.

Welcome to Sphinx-Gallery's documentation!
==========================================

A Sphinx extension that builds an HTML version of any python
script and puts it into an examples gallery.

It is extracted from the scikit-learn project and aims to be an
independent general purpose extension.

Why do we need it?
------------------

* Because we have a lot of code that does something good enough for
  someone to learn about it.
* Looking to the visual output is simpler to our minds than reading
  the source code.
* The Gallery workflow:
   * Search for something that more or less looks to what you want
   * Learn about it
